Project made in React using an API to track faces.

HTML/CSS to highlight the regions provided by the API.

React/Node.JS/PostgreSQL for the front end/back end.

Users can login, their data is stored securely using Bcrypt, their data is retrieved from the database when they login and displayed on the page. When a user submits a link to an image, the API returns co-ordinates that I use CSS/HTML to highlight in a blue box. This updates the user's submitted count number which is displayed in realtime on the page.
